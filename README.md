# catTest

This is an optimised implementation of xERC20 (or ERC-7281). It is inspired by the https://github.com/defi-wonderland/xERC20.

Improvements
Burns are subtracted from mint limit.
Lockbox is set as a bridge rather than as a lockbox while being fully compatible with ERC-7281.
Burns are unlimited. The burn limit serves no protection since Bridge could collect tokens from users anyway.
Single slot bridge config, with major gas improvements.
Minor Differences
No Factory ownership on contract.
Simplified limit logic for easier auditing.
